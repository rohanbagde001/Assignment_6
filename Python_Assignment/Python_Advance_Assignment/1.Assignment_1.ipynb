    "\n",
    "Ans:- object oriented programming is a programming paradigm that provides a means of structuring programs so that \n",
    "      properties and behaviour are bundled into individual objects.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      1. In python object oriented programming(OOPs) uses object and classes in programming\n",
    "      2. It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphism and encapsulation in programming.\n",
    "      3. The main concept of OOPs is to bind data and the functions that work on the together as a single unit so that\n",
    "         no other part of the code can access the data.\n",
    "      It comes with the following advantages.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      1. It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving with the use\n",
    "         of objects.\n",
    "      2. Helps in easy maintainace and modification of existing programme.\n",
