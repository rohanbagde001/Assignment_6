    "     folder, if it's a file then the contents of src will be copied to the destination where dest retains it name\n",
    "     \n",
    "     shutil.copytree() function is used to copy the entire contents of a folder to other folder. it also takes \n",
    "     two arguments src & dest, it copies all the content recursively and stores it in dest. the important catch here \n",
    "     is dest must not exist prior to this and it will be created during the copy operation. Permissions and times \n",
