    "Ans:-\n",
    "    An iterator is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate objects like list ,\n",
    "    tuples, set, etc. Iterators are implemented using a class. It follows lazy evaluation where the evaluation of the\n",
    "    expression will be on a hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid\n",
    "    repeated evaluation. As lazy evaluation is implemented, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and \n",
    "    when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at \n",
    "    the same time will not be there. For an iterator: iter() keyword is used to create an iterator containing an \n",
    "    iterable object.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Similarly generator are an another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses a keyword yield statement\n",
    "    instead of return statement in a defined function. Generators are implemented using a function. just as iterator,\n",
    "    generator also follow lazy evaluation. Here, the yield function return the data without affecting or exiting the\n",
    "    function. It will return a sequence in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence of the use the \n",
    "    data as they won't store the entire sequnce in the memory."

    "    1. List comprehension is more concise and easier to read as compare to map.\n",
    "    2. List comprehension allows filtering. In map, we have no such facility. For example to print all odd numbers in range\n",

    "    3. List comprehension are used when a list of results is required as final output. but map only returns a map object.\n",
    "       it needs to be explicitly coverted to desired database.\n",
