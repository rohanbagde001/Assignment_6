    "1. What exactly is a feature? Give an example to illustrate your point ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Features are the basic building blocks of datasets. The quality of the features in your dataset has a major impact on\n",
    "    the quality of the insights you will gain when you use that dataset for machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Additionally, different business problems within the same industry do not necessarily require the same features, which\n",
    "    is why it is important to have a strong understanding of the business goals of your data science project\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "2. What are the various circumstances in which feature construction is required ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    The features in your data will directly influence the predictive models you use and the results you can achieve. \n",
    "    Your results are dependent on many inter-dependent properties. You need great features that describe the structures \n",
    "    inherent in your data. Better features means flexibility.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Describe how nominal variables are encoded ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "    Nominal data is made of discrete values with no numerical relationship between the different categories — mean and \n",
    "    median are meaningless. Animal species is one example. For example, pig is not higher than bird and lower than fish.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "4. Describe how numeric features are converted to categorical features ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "    Converting categorical features into numeric features using domain knowledge. For example, we are given a list of \n",
    "    countries and say we know the distance to these countries from India then we can replace it with distance from India.\n",
    "    So, every country can be represented as its distance from India.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Describe the feature selection wrapper approach. State the advantages and disadvantages of this approach ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Wrapper methods measure the “usefulness” of features based on the classifier performance. In contrast, the filter \n",
    "    methods pick up the intrinsic properties of the features (i.e., the “relevance” of the features) measured via \n",
    "    univariate statistics instead of cross-validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The wrapper classification algorithms with joint dimensionality reduction and classification can also be used but \n",
    "    these methods have high computation cost, lower discriminative power. Moreover, these methods depend on the efficient\n",
    "    selection of classifiers for obtaining high accuracy.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "6. When is a feature considered irrelevant? What can be said to quantify it ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Features are considered relevant if they are either strongly or weakly relevant, and are considered irrelevant \n",
    "    otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Irrelevant features can never contribute to prediction accuracy, by definition. Also to quantify it we need to first\n",
    "    check the list of features, There are three types of feature selection:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Wrapper methods (forward, backward, and stepwise selection)\n",
    "    Filter methods (ANOVA, Pearson correlation, variance thresholding)\n",
    "    Embedded methods (Lasso, Ridge, Decision Tree).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "7. When is a function considered redundant? What criteria are used to identify features that could be redundant ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "    If two features {X1, X2} are highly correlated, then the two features become redundant features since they have same\n",
    "    information in terms of correlation measure. In other words, the correlation measure provides statistical association\n",
    "    between any given a pair of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Minimum redundancy feature selection is an algorithm frequently used in a method to accurately identify characteristics\n",
    "    of genes and phenotypes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "8. What are the various distance measurements used to determine feature similarity ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Four of the most commonly used distance measures in machine learning are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Hamming Distance.\n",
    "    Euclidean Distance\n",
    "    Manhattan Distance.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "9. State difference between Euclidean and Manhattan distances ?\n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    Euclidean Distance: Euclidean distance is calculated as the square root of the sum of the squared differences between\n",
    "    a new point (x) and an existing point (y).\n",
    "\n",
    "        The Euclidean distance or Euclidean metric is the \"ordinary\" (i.e.straight-line) distance between two points in \n",
    "        Euclidean space.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        The Euclidean distance between points p and q is the length of the line segment connecting them.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    Manhattan Distance: This is the distance between real vectors using the sum of their absolute difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "        It is the sum of the lengths of the projections of the line segment between the points onto the coordinate axes.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "10. Distinguish between feature transformation and feature selection ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:- \n",
    "    Feature selection is for filtering irrelevant or redundant features from your dataset. The key difference between \n",
    "    feature selection and extraction is that feature selection keeps a subset of the original features while feature \n",
    "    extraction creates brand new ones.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "11. Make brief notes on any two of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.SVD (Standard Variable Diameter Diameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Collection of features using a hybrid approach\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. The width of the silhouette\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Receiver operating characteristic curve\n",
    "    \n",
    "Ans:-\n",
    "    1.SVD (Standard Variable Diameter Diameter)"
